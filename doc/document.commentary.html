        <div>TODO: One of the immediate problems I have with candle2 is that the default machine coordinate origin on the
            Genmitsu 4030 seems to be the upper right corner of the work surface.  I want it to be the lower left corner of the work surface.
            I know how to do this using GRBL's "$23=3" command, but I'm unsure where to put this in the code.
            <div style="margin-top: 1em;" class="indent">One possible implementation of this is to create a state machine which waits for a response
                to the <code>btnConnect</code> button, and when the response is received
                sends a $23=3 command to force that mode, and then waits for a response indicating that it was received.  I could also query all the
                parameters with $$, parse the result and then set $23 only if needed.
                <div style="margin-top: 1em; color: black;" class="indent">
                    I'm thinking that I should investigate how to await the <a href="https://github.com/pflagerd/grbl/blob/e5e10b5b0d1d571da7ff85b4265b4773736aef01/doc/markdown/interface.md#L102:~:text=Grbl%20X.Xx%20%5B%27%24%27%20for%20help%5D%20%3A%20Welcome%20message" target="_blank">"Grbl Welcome message"</a>
                    <br>
                    <p>Here's the file in which the serial port gets read from: <code><a href="https://github.com/pflagerd/candle2/blob/4d8efc25080f76c363548fdd3cc6ddc08f5d824c/frmmain_processresponse.cpp#L39">frmmain_processresponse.cpp</a></code></p>
                    <p>Here's the start of a function that gets invoked by a timer, and which processes all serial data received from the 4030XL:</p>
                    <pre>void frmMain::ProcessGRBL1_1() {
while (SerialIf_CanReadLine()) {
    QString data = SerialIf_ReadLine().trimmed();

    if (debug)
        qDebug().nospace() << __FILE__ << " (" << __LINE__ << ") frmMain::ProcessGRBL1_1(): SerialIf_ReadLine().trimmed() returned:" << data;

    if (m_isAwaitingGrblVersionString) { // DPP: is the system in a state where it's waiting for the Grbl Version String which is
                                         // displayed whenever the Grbl processor has been (re-)initialized.
        if (!wasGrblVersionStringReceived(data)) // does <code style="font-size: 100%;">data</code> above contain a Grbl Version String which looks something like "Grbl 1.1h ['$' for help]"
            continue;
        else {
            m_isAwaitingGrblVersionString = false;
            <span title="This is not the timer that triggers the call to void frmMain::ProcessGRBL1_1().  It sends ? messages to the 4030XL every so often.">m_timerStateQuery.setInterval(m_settings->queryStateTime());</span>

    }</pre>
                <br>
                    <p>I think <code>m_isAwaitingGrblVersionString</code> is a flag indicating that Candle is waiting for
                        the <a href="https://github.com/pflagerd/grbl/blob/e5e10b5b0d1d571da7ff85b4265b4773736aef01/doc/markdown/interface.md#L102:~:text=Grbl%20X.Xx%20%5B%27%24%27%20for%20help%5D%20%3A%20Welcome%20message" target="_blank">"Grbl Welcome message"</a> mentioned above</p>
                    <p class="todo">I think <code>m_isAwaitingGrblVersionString</code> belongs with "Grbl Welcome message"
                        in the <a href="../ontology/lexicon.json" target="blank">candle ontology lexicon.</a></p>
                    <p class="todo">Came up with a notion of a URI scheme to identify a specific range of lines/characters in a text document.
                        See <a href="https://chatgpt.com/c/77d7c432-05a1-4aad-9679-0dedf649b426">here</a>.
                    Could use that in conjunction with github's persistent links to identify parts of particular versions
                        of particular documents when we talk about them in here.  Might be a better alternative than Chrome' gross text=thing.  I can't figure out how to get the right-click option
                        in Chrome to do capture the highlighted link text=thing.</p>
                    <p>Before modifying the candle code, I did some experimentation with the GRBL controller.  I created a brain-dead simple terminal program to use to talk to the 4030XL via /dev/ttyUSB0
                    and discovered that the very first thing the 4030XL sends over the serial port when the simple terminal program connects is NOT the "Grbl Welcome message", but a CRLF.  This means there's
                    another state even before the "Grbl Welcome message".</p>
                    <p class="todo">On the subject of the brain-dead simple terminal program mentioned above, it should go into the ontology lexicon, and its URI is github-like and looks like this:
                        <code>git@zax.pflager.net/<span title="Computer Aided Geometric Design">cagd</span>/<span title="G-Code Reader & Interpreter.">grbl.py</span>/blob/c2d1f85817547a100d7cb16ced635e37d37a7762/simplest-terminal-ever.py</code></p>
                    <p class="todo">It would be cool if a processor could walk through the HTML in a document like this one and add hyperlinks and titles to terms defined in the ontology reference.  It would also be cool if there was such a thing as a
                    multi-link, where you could choose from multiple links based on context.  For example, if you hover over grbl.py you could see where its authoritative repository is located, what it's readme.md describes it as, you could open its source for browsing, etc. etc.</p>
                    <p class="todo">It would be insanely great if I could open a VNC session on the remote candle instance, as well as open a camera feed or two.  What about even being able to turn the 4030XL on, off and its dust collector on, off also</p>
